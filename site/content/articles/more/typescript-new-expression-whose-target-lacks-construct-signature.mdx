TS: 'new' expression whose target lacks construct signature

TS: 'new' expression whose target lacks construct signature # The "new expression, whose target
lacks a construct signature" error occurs when we use the new keyword where it shouldn't be used or
use it with a constructor function.

To solve the error, convert the constructor function to a class or remove the new keyword.

Sometimes the solution to the error is to remove the new keyword. If you aren't trying to create an
instance of something, you shouldn't use thenew keyword. Here is an example of how the error occurs.

index.ts

```TypeScript
function Employee(fullName: string, salary: number) {
this.fullName = fullName;
this.salary = salary;

this.getSalary = function () {
return this.salary;
};
}

// ‚õîÔ∏è Error: 'new' expression, whose target lacks a
// construct signature, implicitly has an 'any' type.ts(7009)
const emp1 = new Employee('James Doe', 100);
```

We used the new keyword with a constructor function which caused the error.

TypeScript wants us to convert the constructor function to a class for better type safety.

Convert the constructor function to a class # To solve the error in this situation, convert the
constructor function to a class.

index.ts

```TypeScript
class Employee {
constructor(public fullName: string, public salary: number) {
this.fullName = fullName;
this.salary = salary;
}

getSalary() {
return this.salary;
}
}

const emp1 = new Employee('Bobby Hadz', 100);

console.log(emp1.fullName); // üëâÔ∏è "Bobby Hadz"
console.log(emp1.getSalary()); // üëâÔ∏è 100
```

This class creates equivalent objects to the constructor function but allows us to use the new
keyword to create instances.

TypeScript offers much better type checking for classes than it does for constructor functions.
Using a hacky solution instead # Sometimes you aren't able to convert the function to a class for
one reason or another.

If that's the case, you can use this hacky solution.

```TypeScript
function Employee(this: any, fullName: string, salary: number) {
this.fullName = fullName;
this.salary = salary;

this.getSalary = function () {
return this.salary;
};
}

// ‚úÖ No type checker errors
const emp1 = new (Employee as any)('Bobby Hadz', 100);

console.log(emp1.fullName); // üëâÔ∏è "Bobby Hadz"

console.log(emp1.getSalary()); // üëâÔ∏è 100
```

The first thing we did is type the this keyword in the Employee function - explicitly setting it to
any.

This way we won't get an error when setting properties and methods on this.

We used a type assertion to type the Employee function as any right before using the new keyword.

This gets the type checker to comply but doesn't look great, so it should only be used when you
can't convert the constructor function to a class. In modern code, you rarely see constructor
functions because classes are often more intuitive to work with and get better type safety.

Conclusion # The "new expression, whose target lacks a construct signature" error occurs when we use
the new keyword where it shouldn't be used or use it with a constructor function.

To solve the error, convert the constructor function to a class or remove the new keyword.
