This code runs fine, and yet TypeScript flags an error in it. Why?

```TypeScript
const obj = {
one: 'uno',
two: 'dos',
three: 'tres',
};
for (const k in obj) {
const v = obj[k];
// ~~~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type
//
because type ... has no index signature
}
```

Inspecting the obj and k symbols gives a clue:

```TypeScript
const obj = { /* ... */ };
// const obj: {
//
one: string;
//
two: string;
//
three: string;
// }
for (const k in obj) { // const k: string
// ...
}
```

The type of k is string, but you’re trying to index into an object whose type only has three specific keys: 'one',
'two', and 'three'. There are strings other than these three, so this has to fail. Plugging in a narrower type
declaration for k fixes the issue:

```TypeScript
let k: keyof typeof obj;
for (k in obj) {const v = obj[k];
// OK
}
```

So the real question is: why is the type of k in the first example inferred as string rather than "one" | "two" |
"three"? To understand, let’s look at a slightly different example involving an interface and a function:

```TypeScript
interface ABC {
a: string;
b: string;
c: number;
}
function foo(abc: ABC) {
for (const k in abc) { // const k: string
const v = abc[k];
// ~~~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type
//
because type 'ABC' has no index signature
}
}
```

It’s the same error as before. And you can “fix” it using the same sort of declaration (let k: keyof ABC). But in this
case TypeScript is right to complain. Here’s why:

```TypeScript
const x = {a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 2, d: new Date()};
foo(x); // OK
```

The function foo can be called with any value assignable to ABC, not just a value with “a,” “b,” and “c” properties.
It’s entirely possible that the value will have other proper‐ ties, too (see Item 4). To allow for this, TypeScript
gives k the only type it can be con‐ fident of, namely, string. Using the keyof declaration would have another downside
here:

```TypeScript
function foo(abc: ABC) {
let k: keyof ABC;
for (k in abc) { // let k: "a" | "b" | "c"
const v = abc[k]; // Type is string | number
}
}
```

If "a" | "b" | "c" is too narrow for k, then string | number is certainly too nar‐ row for v. In the preceding example
one of the values is a Date, but it could be any‐ thing. The types here give a false sense of certainty that could lead
to chaos at runtime. So what if you just want to iterate over the object’s keys and values without type errors?
Object.entries lets you iterate over both simultaneously:

```TypeScript
function foo(abc: ABC) {
for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(abc)) {
k // Type is string
v // Type is any
}
}
```

While these types may be hard to work with, they are at least honest! You should also be aware of the possibility of
prototype pollution. Even in the case of an object literal that you define, for-in can produce additional keys:

```TypeScript
> Object.prototype.z = 3; // Please don't do this!
> const obj = {x: 1, y: 2};
> for (const k in obj) { console.log(k); }
x
y
z
```

Hopefully this doesn’t happen in a nonadversarial environment (you should never add enumerable properties to
Object.prototype), but it is another reason that for-in produces string keys even for object literals. If you want to
iterate over the keys and values in an object, use either a keyof declara‐ tion (let k: keyof T) or Object.entries. The
former is appropriate for constants or other situations where you know that the object won’t have additional keys and
you want precise types. The latter is more generally appropriate, though the key and value types are more difficult to
work with.

### Things to Remember

- Use let k: keyof T and a for-in loop to iterate objects when you know exactly what the keys will be. Be aware that any
  objects your function receives as parame‐ ters might have additional keys.
- Use Object.entries to iterate over the keys and values of any object.
