import { ArticleLayout } from "@/layouts/article-layout"

import Image from "next/image"

import image from "./image.png"

export const meta = {
  author: "Alex Vyber",
  date: "2023-01-13",

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

<Image src={image} alt="" className="shadow-lg" />

Yep! We have a bunch of weird and messed up shit in js... And how language allow us to apply methods
on numbers is one of these lovely features!

## Weired syntax (don't write like this)

```TypeScript
 // number-methods.ts

console.log(69..toString()) // "69"
console.log(13.123123.toFixed())  // 13
console.log(666..toExponential()) // 6.66e+2
```

Usually we store number in variable and apply method on it with one dot. When we call methods on
number literal we need some way to tell the interpreter, that we are calling method. So, the second
dot signals that there is no decimal place and the method can be called.

```TypeScript
// number-methods.ts

// ‚ùó syntax error
// üëá will no work
console.log(13.123123..toFixed())
```

As you can guess something will go wrong, if try something like snippet above.

## Encouraged syntax

If for some unbelievably reasonable reason you will be calling methods on literal values, use
braces.

```TypeScript
// number-methods.ts

console.log((69).toString()) // "69"
console.log((13.123123).toFixed()) // 13
console.log((666).toExponential()) // 6.66e+2
```

_If your text editor or IDE formats code, it should insert braces automatically._

Why would I write entire post on something obscure and utterly useless like this? Well... Right now
on the start I want to write about something funüòä
